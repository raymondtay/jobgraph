# Installation of Postgresql server and client, creating the database schemas

The following instructions should work on _ANY_ Debian-like OSes.

*Note:* Make sure you have `sudo` access rights before proceeding.

* Install _postgresql_ server and client
  * ```sudo apt-get install -y postgresql postgresql-client```
  * If prompted for a password, do enter something like : `password`; you don't have to do it this way but it would be easier...
* Next, alter the password of the default `postgres` user
  * ```sudo -u postgres psql postgres```
  * ```\password postgres``` (*note:* make sure its something secure but in this case its `password`)
* At this point in time, you need to edit the file `/etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf` and change the following lines
  * from `local all postgres peer`
  * to `local all postgres md5`
  * and `local all jobgraphadmin md5` (*note:* make sure this particular line appears before the `local all all peer` else you are going to get an authentication error)
* Save the file `/etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf`
* Now, restart the postgresql service so that we can log in again
  * ```sudo service postgresql restart```
* Check the status 
  * ```sudo service postgresqql status```
  * The following output is seen 
```bash
hicoden@dataflow-testing-only:~$ sudo service postgresql status
‚óè postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS

Aug 03 06:43:36 dataflow-testing-only systemd[1]: Started PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```
* Now, we are ready to create the database `jobgraph`, database user `jobgraphadmin` and populate it with schemas
  * ```psql -f ./createdb_tables.sql -U postgres```
* Below is an example of the expected output ... might look a little different by the time you see this.
```bash
Password for user postgres:
CREATE ROLE
psql:./createdb_tables.sql:4: NOTICE:  database "jobgraph" does not exist, skipping
DROP DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE
You are now connected to database "jobgraph" as user "postgres".
